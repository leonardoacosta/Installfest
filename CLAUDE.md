# OpenSpec Instructions

These instructions are for AI assistants working in this project.

Always open `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` when the request:
- Mentions planning or proposals (words like proposal, spec, change, plan)
- Introduces new capabilities, breaking changes, architecture shifts, or big performance/security work
- Sounds ambiguous and you need the authoritative spec before coding

Use `@/openspec/AGENTS.md` to learn:
- How to create and apply change proposals
- Spec format and conventions
- Project structure and guidelines

Keep this managed block so 'openspec update' can refresh the instructions.

## 📖 Documentation Navigation

**New to the project? Start here:**
- [Documentation Index](./docs/INDEX.md) - Complete navigation and quick links
- [Homelab Services Docs](./homelab-services/docs/INDEX.md) - Monorepo documentation

**Key Documentation:**
- **Architecture**: Service-specific guides in [`docs/`](./docs/) (DNS, Home Assistant, Coolify, etc.)
- **OpenSpec Specifications**: Formal specs in [`openspec/specs/`](./openspec/specs/)
- **Homelab Services**: Better-T-Stack monorepo docs in [`homelab-services/docs/`](./homelab-services/docs/)

## Repository Overview

Personal dotfiles and homelab infrastructure automation for macOS and Arch Linux environments. Two main components:

1. **Mac Setup** (`/mac`) - macOS dotfiles, Homebrew packages, system configuration
2. **Homelab Stack** (`/homelab`) - Docker-based self-hosted services for Arch Linux server

## Architecture Summary

### Homelab (Primary Component)

**Deployment**: CI/CD via self-hosted GitHub Actions runners on Arch Linux server

**Network**: Two isolated Docker networks
- `homelab` (172.20.0.0/16) - Core infrastructure (Home Assistant, DNS, AI, security)
- `media` (172.21.0.0/16) - Media services with VPN-protected downloads

**Management**: `homelab/homelab.sh` - Complete setup wizard and interactive menu

**State**: `.setup_state` file tracks wizard progress for resumable setup

### Mac Setup

**Entry Point**: `mac/install.sh` - Interactive installer for Homebrew, packages, dotfiles, and macOS defaults

## Essential Commands

### Homelab Management

```bash
# First-time setup (mandatory wizard)
cd homelab && ./homelab.sh

# Service management
./homelab.sh start [service]    # Start all or specific service
./homelab.sh stop                # Stop all services
./homelab.sh restart [service]   # Restart services
./homelab.sh status              # Show container status
./homelab.sh logs [service]      # View logs

# Maintenance
./homelab.sh update              # Pull latest Docker images
./homelab.sh backup              # Create configuration backup
./homelab.sh deploy              # Trigger GitHub Actions deployment

# Direct deployment (used by CI)
cd homelab/scripts
bash deploy-ci-streamlined.sh    # Streamlined deployment
```

### Mac Setup

```bash
cd mac && ./install.sh           # Run interactive installer
```

## Key Configuration Files

### Homelab

- `docker-compose.yml` - Main orchestrator with includes
- `compose/*.yml` - Service definitions (infrastructure, media, AI, monitoring, etc.)
- `.env` - Environment variables (auto-generated by wizard)
- `traefik/traefik.yml` - Static Traefik configuration
- `traefik/dynamic/*.yml` - Dynamic routes, middlewares, TLS

### Mac

- `homebrew/Brewfile` - Homebrew packages
- `zsh/.zshrc` - Zsh configuration
- `wezterm/wezterm.lua` - Terminal config
- `starship/starship.toml` - Prompt config

## Quick Troubleshooting

### Homelab Issues

**Service won't start:**
```bash
./homelab.sh logs <service>
docker compose ps <service>
```

**Permission errors:** Handled automatically by deployment scripts

**GitHub Runner issues:**
```bash
cd ~/actions-runner
sudo ./svc.sh status
sudo ./svc.sh restart
```

**DNS not resolving:**
```bash
# Check AdGuard status
docker compose ps adguardhome
docker compose logs adguardhome

# Test fallback
dig @1.1.1.1 google.com
```

### Mac Issues

**Build failures:**
```bash
cd mac && ./install.sh  # Re-run installer
```

## Getting Help

1. **Check documentation**: [Documentation Index](./docs/INDEX.md)
2. **Review OpenSpec specs**: [openspec/specs/](./openspec/specs/)
3. **Read archived details**: [openspec/changes/archive/](./openspec/changes/archive/)
4. **Search issues**: Check GitHub Issues for similar problems

## Notes for Claude Code

- **OpenSpec Changes**: Use `/openspec:proposal` for new capabilities, `/openspec:apply` to implement
- **Documentation**: Always check service-specific docs in `docs/` before making changes
- **Testing**: Use `openspec validate --strict` to validate specifications
- **State Management**: Respect `.setup_state` in homelab wizard for resumable operations
- **Archived Content**: Original detailed documentation preserved in `openspec/changes/archive/`
