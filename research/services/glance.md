# Glance Dashboard - Service Synergy Analysis

## Service Overview
Glance is a self-hosted dashboard that provides a unified view of various services, RSS feeds, bookmarks, and other information sources in a clean, customizable interface.

## Synergies with Other Services

### Strong Integrations
1. **Home Assistant**: Can display HA sensors, device states, and automation status directly on dashboard
2. **AdGuard Home**: Monitor DNS query statistics, blocked requests, and filter status
3. **Jellyfin**: Display recently added media, currently playing items, and library statistics
4. **qBittorrent**: Show download progress, speeds, and queue status
5. **Radarr/Sonarr/Lidarr**: Monitor download queues, upcoming releases, and missing media
6. **Prowlarr**: Display indexer status and search statistics
7. **Vaultwarden**: Quick access links and status monitoring
8. **Tailscale**: Network status and connected devices overview

### Complementary Services
- **Nginx Proxy Manager**: Glance benefits from NPM's reverse proxy for secure external access
- **Gluetun**: Can display VPN connection status and location
- **Ollama WebUI**: Quick links and model status display
- **Jellyseerr**: Request statistics and approval queue monitoring
- **NZBGet**: Download queue and completion status

## Redundancies
- **Home Assistant Dashboard**: HA has its own comprehensive dashboard, creating some overlap
- **Individual Service Dashboards**: Each arr service has its own dashboard, though Glance provides unified view
- **Jellyfin Home Screen**: Some media statistics overlap with Jellyfin's native interface

## Recommended Additional Services

### High Priority
1. **Uptime Kuma**: Service health monitoring integration for all stack services
2. **Grafana + Prometheus**: Advanced metrics visualization for deeper insights
3. **Gotify/Ntfy**: Push notification integration for service alerts
4. **Homepage**: Alternative dashboard option with different widget support

### Medium Priority
1. **Scrutiny**: S.M.A.R.T. monitoring for storage health display
2. **Speedtest Tracker**: Internet connection performance monitoring
3. **Pi-hole** (if replacing AdGuard): Alternative DNS statistics
4. **Netdata**: Real-time performance monitoring integration

### Low Priority
1. **Flame**: Bookmark and application launcher alternative
2. **Homarr**: Another dashboard option with different features
3. **Dashy**: Highly customizable dashboard alternative

## Integration Opportunities

### API Integrations
1. Create custom widgets for services without native support
2. Implement webhook receivers for real-time updates
3. Build RSS feed aggregators for arr services' calendars
4. Design health check widgets using each service's API

### Data Aggregation
1. Combine media statistics from Jellyfin, arr services, and download clients
2. Create unified network statistics from AdGuard, NPM, and Tailscale
3. Build comprehensive storage usage displays across all services
4. Aggregate security metrics from Vaultwarden, AdGuard, and NPM

### Automation Triggers
1. Use Glance as a central point for Home Assistant scene activation
2. Implement quick actions for common service tasks
3. Create emergency shutdown buttons for sensitive services
4. Build one-click backup triggers for critical services

## Optimization Recommendations

### Configuration
1. Use environment variables for all service API keys
2. Implement Redis caching for faster widget loading
3. Configure appropriate refresh intervals per widget type
4. Use lazy loading for resource-intensive widgets

### Security
1. Implement read-only API keys where possible
2. Use internal Docker network names for service communication
3. Enable CORS only for specific origins
4. Implement rate limiting for API requests

### Performance
1. Cache static content and API responses
2. Minimize widget refresh rates for stable services
3. Use WebSocket connections for real-time updates where supported
4. Implement progressive loading for dashboard sections

## Key Findings

### What Needs to Be Done
1. Implement comprehensive API integration for all services
2. Create custom widgets for services lacking native support
3. Add health monitoring and alerting capabilities
4. Optimize refresh rates and caching strategies

### Why These Changes Are Beneficial
1. Reduces context switching between multiple service UIs
2. Provides instant visibility into entire stack health
3. Enables faster problem identification and resolution
4. Improves family/user accessibility to services

### How to Implement
1. Start with native integrations for supported services
2. Use Glance's custom HTML/CSS widgets for unsupported services
3. Implement environment-based configuration for easy updates
4. Create widget groups based on service relationships
5. Set up automated health checks with visual indicators
