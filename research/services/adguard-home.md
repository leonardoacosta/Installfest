# AdGuard Home - Service Synergy Analysis

## Service Overview
AdGuard Home is a network-wide DNS server with ad blocking, privacy protection, and parental control features, providing DNS-level filtering for all devices on the network.

## Synergies with Other Services

### Strong Integrations
1. **Home Assistant**: Device presence detection, automation based on DNS queries, network monitoring
2. **Glance**: Display blocking statistics, query counts, and top clients/domains
3. **Nginx Proxy Manager**: DNS resolution for local services, wildcard certificates
4. **Tailscale**: DNS resolution for remote access, split-horizon DNS
5. **All Media Services**: Block ads and trackers in media metadata fetching
6. **Gluetun**: DNS-over-HTTPS through VPN tunnel for privacy

### Complementary Services
- **Jellyfin**: Ad-free streaming experience, faster metadata loading
- **qBittorrent**: Blocking tracker ads and malicious domains
- **Prowlarr**: Safer indexer browsing, blocking malicious redirects
- **Vaultwarden**: Additional security layer for password manager access
- **Ollama**: Reduced tracking when fetching models and data
- **Samba**: Name resolution for SMB shares

## Redundancies
- **Router DNS Filtering**: Some routers offer basic DNS filtering
- **Browser Ad Blockers**: Client-side ad blocking overlaps but less comprehensive
- **Tailscale DNS**: Tailscale has MagicDNS which can conflict

## Recommended Additional Services

### High Priority
1. **Unbound**: Recursive DNS resolver for complete DNS independence
2. **TechnitiumDNS**: Alternative with advanced features and DHCP server
3. **Blocky**: Lighter alternative with similar features
4. **dnscrypt-proxy**: Encrypted DNS upstream connections

### Medium Priority
1. **Pi-hole**: Alternative with different UI and features (not redundant, different approach)
2. **AdGuard Home Sync**: Sync configuration between multiple instances
3. **NextDNS**: Cloud backup for DNS filtering when local fails
4. **Orbital Sync**: Sync blocklists between multiple AdGuard instances

### Low Priority
1. **PowerDNS**: Enterprise-grade DNS with advanced features
2. **BIND9**: Traditional DNS server for complex setups
3. **CoreDNS**: Kubernetes-native DNS for container orchestration

## Integration Opportunities

### DNS-Based Service Discovery
1. Create local DNS entries for all Docker services
2. Implement split-horizon DNS for internal/external access
3. Use DNS rewrites for service aliases
4. Configure conditional forwarding for specific domains

### Security Enhancements
1. **Malware Protection**: Block known malicious domains for all services
2. **Phishing Prevention**: Protect services from connecting to phishing sites
3. **Tracker Blocking**: Prevent telemetry from Docker containers
4. **DNS-over-HTTPS/TLS**: Encrypt DNS queries for privacy

### Monitoring and Analytics
1. Identify services making suspicious DNS queries
2. Track bandwidth usage by analyzing DNS patterns
3. Detect compromised containers via DNS behavior
4. Monitor service health through DNS query patterns

### Automation Possibilities
1. Auto-block domains that services frequently fail to connect to
2. Create time-based filtering rules (kids' devices, work hours)
3. Implement geo-blocking via DNS for certain services
4. Dynamic allowlisting for temporary service needs

## Optimization Recommendations

### Configuration
1. **Upstream DNS**: Use multiple reliable providers (Quad9, Cloudflare, etc.)
2. **Caching**: Optimize cache size based on network size
3. **DHCP Integration**: Serve as DHCP server for automatic client configuration
4. **Custom Filtering**: Create service-specific filter lists

### Performance
1. Implement DNS caching with appropriate TTLs
2. Use parallel upstream queries for faster resolution
3. Enable DNSSEC for security without performance impact
4. Optimize blocklist size (quality over quantity)

### Reliability
1. Configure multiple upstream DNS servers
2. Set up AdGuard Home in HA mode with sync
3. Implement fallback DNS for critical services
4. Use health checks to detect and handle failures

### Security
1. Enable DNS-over-HTTPS for upstream queries
2. Implement rate limiting to prevent DNS amplification attacks
3. Use DNSSEC validation for authenticity
4. Regular blocklist updates and maintenance

## Service-Specific Benefits

### Media Stack (Jellyfin, *arr services)
- Blocks ads in metadata providers
- Prevents tracking from media info services
- Speeds up API calls by blocking unnecessary domains
- Protects against malicious torrent trackers

### Download Services (qBittorrent, NZBGet)
- Blocks malicious tracker domains
- Prevents crypto-mining scripts
- Reduces bandwidth from ad-heavy sites
- Protects against DNS leaks when using VPN

### Home Automation (Home Assistant)
- Provides presence detection via DNS queries
- Blocks telemetry from IoT devices
- Creates local DNS for service discovery
- Enables automation based on network activity

## Key Findings

### What Needs to Be Done
1. Configure local DNS entries for all Docker services
2. Implement split-horizon DNS for Tailscale access
3. Create custom blocklists for homelab-specific threats
4. Set up DNS-over-HTTPS for privacy
5. Enable DHCP server for automatic client configuration

### Why These Changes Are Beneficial
1. Provides network-wide protection without client configuration
2. Improves privacy by blocking tracking at DNS level
3. Speeds up browsing and service access
4. Reduces bandwidth usage from ads and trackers
5. Enables sophisticated network monitoring and automation

### How to Implement
1. Configure as primary DNS server on router or DHCP
2. Create DNS rewrites for internal service names
3. Set up conditional forwarding for local domains
4. Implement monitoring in Home Assistant and Glance
5. Configure upstream DNS with fallback options
6. Create age-appropriate filtering groups
7. Document all custom rules and configurations
