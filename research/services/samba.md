## Integration Opportunities

### Storage Architecture
```mermaid
graph TD
    Storage[Physical Storage] --> Samba[Samba Shares]
    Samba --> Media[/media - Jellyfin]
    Samba --> Downloads[/downloads - qBittorrent]
    Samba --> Backups[/backups - All Services]
    Samba --> Config[/config - Service Configs]
    Samba --> Documents[/documents - Personal]
```

### Media Pipeline Integration
1. **Download Flow**:
   - qBittorrent → /downloads/incomplete
   - Completion → /downloads/complete
   - *arr import → /media/[type]
   - Jellyfin scan → Library update

2. **Backup Strategy**:
   - Service configs → /backups/configs
   - Database dumps → /backups/databases
   - Media metadata → /backups/metadata
   - Container volumes → /backups/volumes

3. **Shared Configuration**:
   - Docker compose files
   - Service configurations
   - Scripts and automation
   - SSL certificates

### Access Control Patterns
1. **User-Based**:
   ```ini
   [media]
   valid users = jellyfin, sonarr, radarr
   write list = sonarr, radarr
   read only = jellyfin
   ```

2. **Service Accounts**:
   - Read-only: Jellyfin, Glance
   - Read-write: *arr services, download clients
   - Admin: Backup services, management

3. **Path Restrictions**:
   - Public: Media libraries
   - Restricted: Configuration files
   - Private: Personal documents

## Optimization Recommendations

### Performance Tuning
1. **SMB Protocol**: Use SMB3 for better performance and security
2. **Caching**: Enable oplocks and kernel oplocks
3. **Buffer Sizes**: Optimize for large media files
4. **Async I/O**: Enable for better concurrent access
5. **Multi-channel**: Use SMB3 multichannel for bandwidth

### Configuration Best Practices
```ini
[global]
min protocol = SMB2
max protocol = SMB3
encrypt passwords = yes
server role = standalone server
obey pam restrictions = yes
unix password sync = yes
passwd program = /usr/bin/passwd %u
pam password change = yes
map to guest = bad user
usershare allow guests = yes

# Performance
socket options = TCP_NODELAY IPTOS_LOWDELAY SO_RCVBUF=131072 SO_SNDBUF=131072
use sendfile = yes
aio read size = 16384
aio write size = 16384
```

### Security Hardening
1. **Authentication**: Require strong passwords, use PAM
2. **Encryption**: Force SMB3 encryption for sensitive shares
3. **Access Logs**: Enable detailed audit logging
4. **Network**: Restrict to specific interfaces/subnets
5. **Permissions**: Use appropriate Unix permissions

## Service-Specific Configurations

### Media Shares
```ini
[media]
path = /srv/media
browseable = yes
read only = yes
guest ok = yes
write list = @mediawriters
force user = media
force group = media
create mask = 0664
directory mask = 0775
```

### Backup Shares
```ini
[backups]
path = /srv/backups
browseable = no
read only = no
valid users = @backup
force user = backup
create mask = 0600
directory mask = 0700
vfs objects = recycle shadow_copy2
```

### Time Machine (macOS)
```ini
[timemachine]
path = /srv/timemachine
browseable = yes
writeable = yes
valid users = @timemachine
fruit:aapl = yes
fruit:time machine = yes
vfs objects = catia fruit streams_xattr
```

## Integration Benefits

## Key Findings

### What Needs to Be Done
1. Configure SMB3 with encryption for security
2. Create structured share hierarchy for services
3. Implement user/group-based access control
4. Set up automated backup shares
5. Configure Time Machine support for Mac clients

### Why These Changes Are Beneficial
1. Provides centralized storage for all services
2. Enables direct file management without service APIs
3. Simplifies backup and restore procedures
4. Offers familiar file access for non-technical users
5. Reduces storage redundancy across services

### How to Implement
1. Deploy Samba container with persistent config
2. Create directory structure for different purposes
3. Configure shares with appropriate permissions
4. Set up user accounts and groups
5. Map shares in docker-compose for services
6. Configure SMB3 and encryption
7. Set up recycle bin for accidental deletions
8. Implement shadow copies for versioning
9. Document share purposes and access methods
10. Test performance with large media files
