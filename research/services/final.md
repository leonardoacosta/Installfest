5. **Headscale** - Self-hosted Tailscale controller

### 3. Major Redundancies Identified

#### Services with Overlapping Functions
1. **Dashboard Services**: Glance vs Home Assistant dashboards
   - **Resolution**: Use Glance for at-a-glance monitoring, HA for control

2. **VPN Services**: Tailscale vs Gluetun
   - **Resolution**: Tailscale for access, Gluetun for privacy

3. **Download Methods**: qBittorrent vs NZBGet
   - **Resolution**: Keep both for redundancy and content availability

4. **Request Systems**: Built-in vs Jellyseerr
   - **Resolution**: Standardize on Jellyseerr for all requests

### 4. Integration Opportunities

#### Automation Workflows

**Smart Home Media Control**
```yaml
Trigger: Motion detected in living room
Actions:
  1. Check if Jellyfin is streaming
  2. Dim lights appropriately
  3. Pause downloads if bandwidth needed
  4. Resume when streaming stops
```

**Intelligent Content Management**
```yaml
Trigger: New request approved
Actions:
  1. Ollama analyzes request context
  2. Suggests optimal quality/source
  3. Monitors download progress
  4. Generates descriptions/tags
  5. Notifies when ready
```

**Security Automation**
```yaml
Trigger: New device on network
Actions:
  1. AdGuard logs DNS queries
  2. Home Assistant checks device
  3. Alert if unknown
  4. Block if suspicious
```
